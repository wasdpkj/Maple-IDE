USB
===

The STM32 microprocessors include a dedicated USB peripheral which can
be configured to act as a general USB slave device with transfer rates
up to 12Mbps. (It unfortunately can't be configured as a host or
on-the-go device).  By default, the peripheral is configured for two
uses: first, to receive sketch/program uploads from the :ref:`IDE
<ide>`, and second, to emulate a regular serial port for use as a
terminal (text read/write).

The emulated terminal is relatively slow and inefficient; it is best
for transferring data at regular serial speeds (kilobaud).  Library
support for accessing the emulated terminal is available at the
:ref:`SerialUSB <lang-serialusb>` reference.

The SerialUSB channel is used with the :ref:`Maple bootloader
<bootloader>` to reprogram the board: a :ref:`magic sequence of
control line toggles and transmitted data <bootloader-rev3>` causes a
Maple to reset itself and enter bootloader mode. As an unfortunate
consequence, the auto-reset will not work if the IDE can not access
the serial port, either due to a conflict with another program (serial
monitor) or because the interface has been disabled from the Maple
side (through :ref:`SerialUSB.end() <lang-serialusb-end>`).  A
solution to the second problem is the use of :ref:`perpetual
bootloader mode <troubleshooting-perpetual-bootloader>`.
